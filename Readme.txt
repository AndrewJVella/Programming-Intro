These are the assignments in mind for crash course introduction to programming. The paramount goal of this crash course is to demonstrate that the computer is a machine you can use, and own. Modern computers are designed to make us forget the machine is a machine, and not a magical device, or a palantir from Lord of the Rings. Computers have a history, and a logic. Know the machine, own the machine, save money on apps and subscriptions for the machine. 

The answer key is written largely in python, with a bit of html. I did my best to implement everything myself, out of fairness to you. That said, there are plenty of websites with open source code to read, like GeeksforGeeks and W3. There are also plenty of good videos out there, by people like uniprod, Computerphile, and Tom7. This did not all come right off the dome. There may still be a few typos in this doc.

SECTION A - Hello Worlds 
This section is all about putting things on the screen. At this stage, the goal is just to get the computer to show you something you made. 

Hello World
	- A standard introduction to any programming language, simply print "Hello World" to the screen.
About Me Page
	- Make your own webpage in html, with a bio, image, and link.
Funny Fill-in
	- Write your own funny story with blanks to fill in, MadLibs style.
Turtle
	- Use Python's turtle module to draw a star, smiley, or heart


SECTION B - Conditionals, Loops, and Variables
Now that you have learned output. It is time to learn to process input. These programs demonstrate important principles, like storing input with variables and then applying logic to produce an appropriate output. These conditional behaviors are how a computer actually computes. Loops will also be covered in this section. Loops let the computer repeat actions, like taking a prompt from the user. Conditionals are used to open and close loops. This section includes a few games to play, and an old mainstay called "Fizz Buzz". 

Babbling Baby
	- The babbling baby takes a question (input) and randomly answers with "yes", "no", or "i don't know" (or whatever else you like)
Fizz Buzz
	- The Fizz Buzz program prints numbers with some substitutes. If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5, print "FizzBuzz"
Guess the Number
	- The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 10. You can guess until you guess correctly. If you guess low, the computer will print "Higher!". If you guess high, the computer will print "Lower!". The number of guesses you made will be displayed when you guess correctly
Rock Paper Scissors
	- Implement the game "Rock Paper Scissors" and have the computer make a random selection. Then have the player pick an option. Use conditionals to determine wins, loses, and draws


SECTION C - Arrays and Functions
Arrays are groups of variables that can be used to organize data. Variables in an array are indexed. The first index in an array is usually called index 0 (but some languages do use 1, like Scratch and Lua) The number of indices an array has is called its length. An array of six variables has a length of five (unless it is six). Loops can be used to iterate over arrays and do stuff to each item (or element, or index). Pick the terms that you like best. 

A function is a program that can be run by a larger program. (That is, for the purposes of an introduction to programming. Please, spare me. "Um, actually, functions are integral to a stateless programming paradigm called Lambda Calculus, first described by Alonzo Church in 1936. It has been implemented in functional languages, like Haskell and Clojure, because stateless programs do not have side effects, which makes them awesome [for nuking the call stack]. A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, isn't that so simple?! [AAAAAAAAA]...") 

Anyway, a function is a program that can be run by a larger program. Functions are great because they allow you to describe your program in terms of smaller programs. These smaller programs can accept input, called arguments or parameters. Functions can also output, also called returning a value. You can run them from anywhere in your program, by making a function call. This saves a whole lot of debugging, and copy-paste. Functions can be tested independently from the rest of your program, and are powerful enough to do all of the computation you will ever need without bothering with silly things like global scopes, or program states, or object inheritance patterns, or even numbers in general. Why write 3, when you can write lambda(lambda(lambda(x)))? Seriously though, while purely functional languages can be impractical, functional programming is a game changer. You can actually organize, test, and maintain code with these things.

Array Generator
	- Write functions to generate an array of ordered numbers, one of shuffled numbers, and one of reversed order. IE: [1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [3, 2, 1]. Have each function take an argument n, that specifies array length
Linear Search
	- Write a search function that locates a target number in an array of numbers. Have it check each index in order until locating the target or completing a check on every index. If the search does not find anything, indicate this. Note: the index of an array refers to the position of an item in an array. The leftmost item is usually at index zero. This search should return (output) an index, or -1 if the target is not found.
Prime Number Generator
	- Write a program that generates prime numbers out to a maximum value (n). A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and one. (IE: 2, 3, 5, 7). (Note: Construct an array of primes using a loop and the modulus operator.)   
Pascal's triangle
	- Write a function to generate lines of Pascal's triangle out to a specific number of iterations (an argument, n) After line two, each value on the current line is the sum of two values on the previous line. IE:
	1
	1 1
	1 2 1 
	1 3 3 1
	1 4 6 4 1
	and so on

SECTION D - Recursion
Recursion is what happens when a function calls itself. It is great for doing stuff that can technically be done with loops, but is annoying to do with loops. Just be aware of the infinite recursion. Your program can only store so much on the call stack. Recursive functions often need a base case, to tell the function that it is time to stop calling itself. A recursive function can also have a loop in it, and often does.

Factorial
	- Write a function that returns the factorial of a (natural) number. n factorial is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3)... to 1. Five factorial (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Use a recursive function, such that factorial(n) returns n * factorial(n - 1). The factorial of 1 is also 1. So factorial(1) can return 1 (called a base case).
Binary Search 
	- This is a search function that searches on an array sorted from least to greatest. You use this search when you are looking for a specific page in a book. You start in the middle, about halfway into the book. If your page is lower, you go to the first quarter of the book. If your page is higher, you go to the third quarter of the book. Then you check eighths of the book, closing in on your target page. Implement this search recursively. Return -1 if your target is not found, such as targeting page 300 in a 250 page book.
Number Namer
	- This program takes a natural number, and outputs the english name of that number. 1 returns "one". 23 returns "twenty three". 154 returns "one hundred fifty four". Numbers beyond 9999 should return "ten thousand or greater" (or "one myriad or greater").
Sirpinski's Triangle
	- Use turtle graphics to produce generations of Sirpinski's triangle. This is a self-similar fractal that looks a bit like the "Triforce" from "The Legend of Zelda", if each piece was made of smaller copies. Take an (upright) triangle, put an inverted triangle in the center. The inverted triangle is now surrounded by three smaller upright triangles. Put inverted triangles in the centers of these, and continue to recur to a chosen max; like n = 6.
Dragon Curve
	- Use recursion and turtle graphics to produce generations of the Dragon Curve. This is a self-similar fractal composed of ninety degree turns. The first generation is a right turn. The next is a right, then a right, then a then a left. To get each new generation, start with two  copies of the turn sequence from the previous generation. Take the first copy and append a right turn to the end of it. Take the second copy and reverse it. Then invert each turn in the second copy, such that rights become lefts and lefts become rights. Append this new sequence to the right turn that was appended to the first copy. Recur to a chosen max; like n = 12.

SECTION E - Sorting Algorithms
Okay, so a computer scientist walks into a library and finds a whole shelf has been knocked down onto the floor. Good Samaritans get the shelf back up and steady, but now a whole bunch of books need to be organized, without using anymore shelves. The computer scientist says "Ok, I think this book should be the pivot, or maybe we can put 'AAAAAA: The Book of Screams' on the shelf first." Sorting algorithms sort stuff, usually numbers, but they can sort words and other things too. They tend to perform quite well on stuff that has already been sorted, and still do good on stuff that is not sorted, but if you want to give them a real challenge, take a sorted list, and put it in reverse. (Sorted order generally means sorted from least to greatest. Greatest to least would be considered reverse order.)

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort
	- Write a function to sort a list of numbers. Do not concern efficiency yet. Choose between: Bubble Sort, which swaps pairs of adjacent numbers until sorted; Selection Sort, which selects the largest unsorted value, and puts in in sorted order; or Insertion Sort, which compares values to a key value, and then inserts the key into its sorted position.  Your algorithm will almost certainly use a loop, nested inside a loop. Test your algorithm on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. 
Merge Sort
	- This is a sorting algorithm that uses a "divide and conquer" strategy. An array of numbers is split in half, then the halves are split in half, and so on until each part contains only one value. (The array is divided into many arrays with a single value each.) These arrays are then merged back together using a function called merge() that takes two arrays, and outputs a merged array. The original array is ultimately reconstructed in sorted order. Test your algorithm on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. As an optional challenge you can implement Tim sort, which uses insertion sort on sections of the array (called runs), before merging them together.
Quick Sort
	- Quick sort uses a partition. A value on the array is chosen to be the pivot. This partitions the array into two partitions, called high and low. Everything higher than the pivot is sorted to the right, into the high partition, and everything less than the pivot is sorted to the left. Then another pivot is selected. Generally, the median is chosen as the pivot, such that a left half of the array is low, and the other half is high. Then each partition is also partitioned recursively, by halves, until partitions of only one value are produced. However, the partition may also be chosen randomly, or as a high value, or as a low value. Test your algorithm on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. 
Bogo Sort
	- This is an impractical sorting algorithm that demonstrates how not to sort effectively. Fortunately, it does provide a lesson in verification functions (or verifiers). This algorithm checks if an array is sorted, and if the array is not sorted, the array gets shuffled until it is sorted. You can also implement bozo sort, which randomly swaps values instead of shuffling the whole array. Test your algorithm on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. Keep yours test arrays at a length greater than two, but less than five.   


SECTION F - Data Structures
A data structure is like a physical structure, except it is made of data instead. These are the puddings of computing, and a general term for "anything that is useful for organizing stuff in some way", even just throwing it all in a heap. So there are lots of data structures, like queues and stacks and trees and heaps. You can use object oriented programming to implement these (but Python is not great for that). Most of the time you can use arrays to implement these, if you prefer.

Game of Telephone
	-  A queue is a data structure with a simple rule, "first in, first out" or "first come, first serve" You have been in one these every time you stand in line. Standing in line is boring, so this assignment simulates a game of Telephone instead. This is a game you may have played as a small child. Kids sit in a row and the first one gets to pick something to whisper in their friend's ear. Then the friend whispers something to the next kid, which might resemble what the first kid whispered. So it goes down the chain of kids until the last one proclaims something. Does the last kid's phrase match the first kid? Probably not. In this simulation, The first kid gets a word, they run a mutating function on it, and then they pass it on to the next one, who mutates the word again. Each kid comes with some random parameters that determine what they will do. A kid may ignore the word they were given and randomly say something else. They may switch letters around, or swap them out for random letters. The word will be printed each time this happens. You may also give each kid a random name that prints alongside their mutation, and call them silly if they ignore the word they were given. You can use text files, or dictionaries, to store silly words and names.
Game of War
	- A stack is a data structure with a simple rule "last in, first out". These work exactly like they do on your plate of pancakes. The pancake at the top gets plated last and eaten first. Stacks also describe decks of cards, (and lots of concepts in computer programming: function calls, memory, scopes...). This assignment implements a card game using stacks of cards, called War. Generally, War is a pared down card game, the kind that comes down to luck, not skill. This is good, because it does not have too many rules or exceptions. This assignment pares the game down to a minimal rule set. First, the deck is shuffled and dealt to two players, so each gets half the deck. Second, on each turn each player plays one card from the deck, and the two cards are compared to determine who gets a point. This continues until all cards are played, and then the player with the most points is the winner . Third, points are awarded according to the cards played in each turn. Cards have one of four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades in American Bridge Suit Order; and one of thirteen ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, for fifty two cards. Aces beat Kings, Twos beat Aces, Threes beat Twos; no Jokers. The higher ranking card wins the point for that player. If cards are of the same rank, the players go to war. Fourth, to keep things simple, when a war happens, the player of higher suit wins. Spades beat Hearts, which beat Diamonds, which beat Clubs. There are variations on this game where four cards are played during a war, and each player cycles their played cards back into the deck, or their own deck. For the purposes of this assignment, the gameplay can be minimal, and the computer can play against itself.
Binary Tree Traversal
	- A Binary Tree is a data structure where nodes are arranged into parents and children. A node usually stores a number, but it can also store other things. A parent can have no children, one child, or two children, but no more. This rule set forms a tree-like structure, with a root that has no parents, and leaves that have no children. (The "root" is analogous to the trunk of an actual tree. It branches off into branches, which branch off into leaves) This structure is ideal for short-term storage, as every child can be accessed from the root of the tree, using a traversal. A traversal visits every node in the tree, from root to leaves, or leaves to root, left child to parent to right child. Any traversal is acceptable as long as every node in the tree is visited before the traversal completes. You can use an array to store your tree, recursion to traverse your tree, and a "visited" array to keep track of visited nodes during the traversal. (You might be thinking "Just use a table, so there is no traversing!" Although a binary tree needs to be traversed, this structure can store and free data easily, because there is always a leaf, ready to adopt a child, somewhere on the tree. A table may have faster look up times, but data cannot share a cell. Cells need to be specifically managed for storage.) Note: for a tree implemented as an array, the root is at index 0. To get the children of the node at index i, take index 2i + 1 for the left child and 2i + 2 for the right child. To get the parent of a node, divide the index by two and round down.
Heap Sort
	- A heap is a specific kind of binary tree. First, the binary tree must be complete, such that if there is an even number of nodes, then every parent must have two children. A complete binary tree can have an odd number of nodes, if and only if the parent with one child is in the rightmost position, furthest from the root (and therefore at the largest index in an array) In a max heap, the largest value on the tree is stored in the root, and each parent node stores a value larger than its children. In a min heap, the root has the smallest value, and children have larger values. This is called the heap property, and a heapify function is used to maintain this property as the heap is manipulated (by adding or removing nodes). Use a max heap (or min heap) to sort an array of values. Test your algorithm on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array.

SECTION G - Algorithm Comparisons
Which algorithm is faster? Which one should I use here? How do I decide? It is finally time to see time and space complexity in action. Hooray for efficiency.

Search Compare
	- Write a program that compares searching algorithms, tracking elapsed time, and the number of checks made (where a check is used to assess if the target is found). Compare linear search to binary search. (Run binary search twice, start the time before the array is sorted, and again start the time after the sort. You may use any sort you like, provided it actually sorts the array in a reasonable amount of time. In theory, time should be measured in milliseconds. (In practice that can be hard to prove, even with a computer. All that matters is that timings are consistent across searches) You can use the time module to measure time down to the nanosecond (apparently). Note each sort needs to be given the same input. If you are using a shuffled array of some length, make sure each algorithm gets the same shuffle. You can use this by using the copy module to pass a deep copy of the array to each one, passing by value, not reference. Test your algorithms on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. You can use global variables to track metrics.
Sort Compare
	- Write a program that compares sorting algorithms, tracking elapsed time, and the number of comparisons made. (A comparison is one check for a swap, or merge) Choose three sorting algorithms to compare, including a recursive one (or otherwise O(nlog(n)) one) such as merge, quick, or heap. Do not compare the bogo or bozo sorts, nor any joke sorts that do not actually work in a reasonable time frame. (If you do, you may have to wait far too long.) In theory, time should be measured in milliseconds. (In practice that can be hard to prove, even with a computer. All that matters is that timings are consistent across sorts) You can use the time module to measure time down to the nanosecond (apparently). Note each sort needs to be given the same input. If you are using a shuffled array of some length, make sure each algorithm gets the same shuffle. You can use this by using the copy module to pass a deep copy of the array to each one, passing by value, not reference. Test your algorithms on a sorted array, a shuffled array, and a reversed array. You can use global variables to track metrics. Finally, please note that you do not have to sort a very large array. Pick large enough for significant results, but do not spend six hours running bubble sort on one million integers. 

	(Yes, I did that for a class. Yes, it was required, and it actually took six hours. My laptop was a Macbook and I have been reluctant to use one ever after. I added printed messages to see what was taking so long. It was bubble sort, an entire evening of bubble sort. After the first night, I saw the crash in the morning, and realized I would need to keep an eye on things the entire time. I added beeps and boops to the project so I could monitor it by ear while doing laundry, and watching the presidential debate. On the day the project was due, the other students were complaining that "bubble sort took thirty minutes to run". I said "it took six hours on my Mac", and so I won the complaint contest. I doubt the professor wanted me to spend all evening with bubble sort, and just did not imagine a modern (2020) laptop could actually take six hours to do any comparison sort.)
